# Prediction of Stock Price Movements Based on Financial Ratios Using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Method

## Thesis by Nakhwa Azizah

### Developed a predictive model for stock price movements using financial ratios and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) architecture. The project involved data collection from Yahoo Finance and Stockbit, data preprocessing, and feature reduction using PCA. The model classified stock movements into three categories (up, stagnant, down) based on percentage change thresholds. Performance evaluation compared predictions using financial ratios versus historical stock data, offering insights to support data-driven investment decisions.
